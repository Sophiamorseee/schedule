This course emphasizes program design process, object-oriented software development approach, and practical programming skills that translate to programming in other modern languages. Assignments include practical problems drawn from various fields (e.g. biology, linguistics, graphics, and games). Open to high-school students only, no prerequisites. Credits donâ€™t count toward Coordinate Major in Computer Science."

This course emphasizes program design process, object-oriented software development approach, and development of practical programming skills that translate to programming in other modern languages. This is a stand-alone introductory computer science course that is not a part of the coordinate major in computer science program. It is aimed at students with no prior computing background who wish to learn the foundations of programming and computational problem solving."

                description: "Computational tools are a critical part of our everyday lives. Software is the driving force behind cutting-edge scientific discovery, blockbuster entertainment, and today's fast-paced marketplace. This course is an introduction to techniques, ideas, and problem-solving approaches that are used to develop some of these tools. At a high level, we focus on developing 'computational thinking', which is the practice of using abstraction to design and implement algorithms and software to solve problems that arise in many different areas of our daily lives, such as networks, social media, and scientific computing, to name just a few. At a practical level, students will design, implement, test and document their programs to learn introductory programming concepts, such as: data types and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries, trees); programming techniques (modular design using functions, recursion, object-oriented programming); performance analysis via theoretical estimate, profiling and timing. Most assignments in this course are programming assignments aimed to teach the students to express their ideas in efficient and elegant code; no prior programming experience is necessary to join and succeed in the course. Lecture periods are dedicated to introducing new material, discussions, individual and group activities. Lab periods are used for programming practice. CMPS 1500 is the first course for the Coordinate Major in Computer Science."

Object-oriented programming, test-driven development, data structures and abstract data types, imperative programming and memory management, and functional programming will all be covered. By solving practical, real-life problems in different programming languages and in different ways, students learn to select a language and approach most appropriate for the situation and prepare to learn new languages independently. The high-level goal of this course is to train students to be able to draw from a versatile set of skills, which in turn will provide a strong foundation for further study in computer science.",
